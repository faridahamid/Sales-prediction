# Sales Prediction 

This project aims to predict **weekly sales** by analyzing and merging multiple datasets, including fuel pricing, weather conditions, and historical sales data. The notebook (`Weekly_Sales_.ipynb`) explores relationships between these variables to build an accurate predictive model.



##  Project Files

- `Weekly_Sales_.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling  
- `sales - sales.csv` – Historical weekly sales data  
- `fuel pricing - fuel pricing.csv` – Fuel price data by date/location  
- `weather - weather.csv` – Weather conditions that may influence sales

##  Project Highlights

- **Data Merging**  
  Joins the three datasets based on common keys like date or store location to create a unified dataset for modeling.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Includes visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the relationships between weather, fuel prices, and sales.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Extracts useful insights from raw data and transforms it into machine-readable format.

- **Model Building**  
  Applies machine learning algorithms to predict the `Weekly_Sales` variable and evaluates their performance.
